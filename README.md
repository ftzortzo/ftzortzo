- 👋 Hi, I’m Filippos Tzortzoglou, a PhD student at Cornell University. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and how their presence can positively influence the whole transportation network from the perspective of safety, energy efficiency, travel time, fairness and comfort. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studing the problem of controlling CAVs approaching signalized intersections while controlling traffic light phases in mixed traffic enviroments, where both CAVs and human driven vehicles exist. 
- 💞️ If you are working on a similar aera and you want to collaborate you can reach me at 📫 ft253@cornell.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love soccer and Premier League and I am a (big) supporter of Arsenal F.C. Go Go Gunners!
